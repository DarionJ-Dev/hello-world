Hello World,

I hope this is the beginning of something great, the beginning of an oasis of new ideas for those tired of drudging through the desert. 
Eat, drink, and be merry but remember that you can not stay here forever when society is on the other side of the desert. Nonetheless,
take some water as you go and show others that greatness still rises from places of misery.

You simply need to find it,

W-Watts
